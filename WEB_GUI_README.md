# Web GUI for UPS Power Management Server

## Overview

The Web GUI for UPS Server provides easy management of system configuration through a web interface accessible from any browser. The interface is fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Web GUI Features

### üè† Dashboard
-   **System Overview**: Displays key statistics (number of managed hosts, sentinels, UPS clients).
-   **Sentinel Host Status**: Real-time monitoring of sentinel devices used to detect power failures.
-   **UPS Client Status**: Shows a live, detailed status reported directly by each UPS client. The possible states include:
 -   `Online`: The client is running and reporting correctly.
 -   `Shutting down...`: A live countdown for clients that are in the process of shutting down.
 -   `WoL sent`: The server has sent a Wake-on-LAN packet, and is waiting for the client to boot up.
 -   `Status Stale`: The client has stopped reporting its status, indicating a potential issue.
 -   `Awaiting status...`: The client has not yet reported its status for the first time.
-   **Automatic Refresh**: Statuses are automatically refreshed every 5 seconds.
-   **One-Click WoL**: Buttons to manually send Wake-on-LAN signals to hosts.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
- **Main Configuration**: Edit system parameters (sentinel hosts, WoL delay, broadcast address)
- **Managed Host Management**: Add, edit, and remove hosts. For each host, you can configure Wake-on-LAN, optional UPS client functionality, and enable or disable automatic startup after a power outage.
- **Data Validation**: Automatic validation of IP addresses and MAC addresses with error feedback
- **Auto-formatting**: Intelligent MAC address formatting during input
- **Unified Configuration**: Single interface for all host parameters including optional UPS client settings
- **Power Outage Simulation**: A dedicated switch to manually enable or disable a simulated power outage, allowing for easy testing of the entire shutdown and recovery workflow.
- **Scheduler Management:** Create, edit, and delete schedules to automate the start and stop of Power Outage Simulation.

## Installation and Configuration

### 1. Update Application Files

Copy the new files to your application directory:

```bash
# Navigate to the application directory
cd /opt/ups-server-docker/app

# Create templates directory
mkdir -p templates

# Copy new files (web_gui.py, templates/base.html, templates/dashboard.html, templates/config.html)
```

### 2. Docker Updates

Replace existing files:

  - `entrypoint.sh` - adds Web GUI startup on port 80
  - `Dockerfile` - adds port 80 and templates directory
  - `docker-compose.yml.example` - documents port 80
  - `api.py` - updated to use consolidated configuration

### 3. Container Rebuild

```bash
# Stop existing container
docker compose down

# Rebuild and start with new files
docker compose up --build -d
```

## Accessing the Web GUI

After starting the container, the Web GUI will be available at:

```
http://<UPS_SERVER_IP>
```

For example, if your UPS server has IP `192.168.1.10`, open:

```
http://192.168.1.10
```

## Ports and Services

After the update, the container will provide the following services:

  - **Port 80**: Web GUI (new)
  - **Port 5000**: REST API (existing)
  - **Port 3493**: NUT Server (existing)

## Configuration Management

### Unified Configuration File

All system configuration is now managed through a single file: `power_manager.conf`. This file contains:

  - **Main Settings**: Sentinel hosts, WoL delay, broadcast addresses, and the power outage simulation toggle.
  - **Host Definitions**: Each `[WAKE_HOST_X]` section can include:
      - `NAME`: Descriptive name
      - `IP`: Host IP address
      - `MAC`: MAC address for Wake-on-LAN
      - `BROADCAST_IP`: Optional specific broadcast IP
      - `SHUTDOWN_DELAY_MINUTES`: Optional - makes host a UPS client
      - `AUTO_WOL`: Optional - set to "false" to disable automatic WoL

  - **Schedule Definitions**: Each `[SCHEDULE_X]` section defines a one-time or recurring job to enable or disable the simulation mode.

### Example Configuration

```bash
# === CONFIGURATION FILE FOR POWER_MANAGER.SH ===

SENTINEL_HOSTS=192.168.1.11 192.168.1.12 192.168.1.13
WOL_DELAY_MINUTES=5
DEFAULT_BROADCAST_IP=192.168.1.255
UPS_STATE_FILE=/var/run/nut/virtual.device

# === WAKE-ON-LAN HOST DEFINITIONS ===

# UPS Client (with shutdown delay)
[WAKE_HOST_1]
NAME=Synology NAS
IP=192.168.1.12
MAC=00:11:32:f8:af:9f
SHUTDOWN_DELAY_MINUTES=10

# WoL-only host (no UPS functionality)
[WAKE_HOST_2]
NAME=File Server
IP=192.168.1.15
MAC=00:11:32:aa:bb:cc
```

## Responsive Design and Mobile Optimization

The Web GUI is designed for accessibility across all devices:

### üì± Mobile Features:

  - **Responsive design**: Automatic adaptation to screen size
  - **Touch-friendly**: Large buttons and elements easy to tap
  - **Scrollable tables**: Tables with large amounts of data are horizontally scrollable
  - **Optimized forms**: Modal dialogs adapted to mobile screens
  - **Clear icons**: Font Awesome icons with clear status indicators

### üíª Desktop Features:

  - **Hover effects**: Animations on mouse hover
  - **Advanced tables**: Full tables with more information
  - **Wide layouts**: Full utilization of screen width
  - **Keyboard navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility

## Security

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notes:

1.  **No Authentication**: The Web GUI does not have a login system. Access is open to anyone who knows the server's IP address.

2.  **Internal Use**: The interface is designed for use within a secure internal network.

3.  **No HTTPS**: Communication occurs over unencrypted HTTP.

### üîí Security Recommendations:

  - Use the Web GUI only on trusted local networks
  - Consider restricting access through firewall rules
  - For production environments, consider adding authentication

## Troubleshooting

### Web GUI doesn't load

1.  Check if container is running: `docker ps`
2.  Check logs: `docker compose logs`
3.  Check port 80 availability: `curl http://localhost`

### Cannot save configuration

1.  Check permissions on configuration files
2.  Check application logs: `docker compose logs ups-server`
3.  Verify configuration files exist in `./config/`

### Host status doesn't refresh

1.  Check network connectivity from container
2.  Check browser logs (F12 -\> Console)
3.  Verify `/status` and `/client_statuses` endpoints respond: `curl http://<SERVER_IP>/status`

### Wake-on-LAN problems

1.  Ensure you're using `network_mode: host` in docker-compose.yml
2.  Check if `wakeonlan` is installed in the container
3.  Verify MAC addresses and broadcast IP addresses are correct

## Advanced Features

### Automatic Status Refresh

  - Status of all hosts is automatically refreshed every 5 seconds.
  - You can manually refresh status by clicking the "Refresh" button.

### Form Validation

  - IP addresses are automatically validated.
  - MAC addresses are formatted during input (XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX).
  - Invalid data is highlighted with error messages.

### Notifications

  - All actions (saving, adding, deleting) show notifications.
  - Notifications automatically disappear after 3-5 seconds.
  - Errors are displayed in red, success messages in green.

## API Integration

The API now includes endpoints for both configuration and status reporting.

  - `GET /config?ip=<client_ip>` - Returns UPS client configuration.
  - `POST /status` - Receives status updates from clients (e.g., shutdown countdown).
  - `GET /upsc` - Returns live UPS status.

Example API response for a UPS client:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" "http://server:5000/config?ip=192.168.1.12"
```

```json
{
  "SHUTDOWN_DELAY_MINUTES": "10",
  "UPS_NAME": "ups@192.168.1.10"
}
```

## Migration from Previous Versions

If upgrading from a version that used separate `upshub.conf`:

1.  **Backup existing configuration**:

    ```bash
    cp config/power_manager.conf config/power_manager.conf.backup
    ```

2.  **Add UPS client settings**: For each host that should be a UPS client, add `SHUTDOWN_DELAY_MINUTES` to its `[WAKE_HOST_X]` section.

3.  **Remove old file**: The `upshub.conf` file is no longer needed.

4.  **Update Web GUI**: Replace `web_gui.py` and templates with the unified versions.

## Web GUI Endpoints

The Web GUI provides these endpoints for management:

  - `GET /` - Main dashboard
  - `GET /config` - Configuration page
  - `POST /save_main_config` - Save main configuration
  - `POST /add_wake_host` - Add new managed host
  - `POST /edit_wake_host/<section>` - Edit managed host
  - `POST /delete_wake_host/<section>` - Delete managed host
  - `GET /wol/<section>` - Send Wake-on-LAN signal
  - `GET /status` - Get current host ping status (JSON)
  - `GET /client_statuses` - Get detailed client statuses (JSON)
  - `POST /add_schedule` - Add new schedule for power outage simulation
  - `POST /edit_schedule/<section>` - Edit an existing schedule
  - `POST /delete_schedule/<section>` - Delete a schedule

All Web GUI endpoints are independent of the existing REST API on port 5000, which continues to work without changes for UPS clients.
