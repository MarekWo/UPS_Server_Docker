# .dockerignore for UPS Server Docker
# 
# This file excludes files from Docker build context while preserving
# the complete Git repository for version information.
#
# NOTE: .git directory is NOT excluded so that version information
# can be generated during Docker build.

# If you must exclude .git, the system will fall back to runtime versioning
