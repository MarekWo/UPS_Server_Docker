# === WAKE-ON-LAN HOST DEFINITIONS ===
# Define each host that should be awakened after power restoration
# Each host should have its own section with the following parameters:
# NAME - A descriptive name for the host (for logging purposes)
# IP - The IP address of the host
# MAC - The MAC address of the host (use colons as separators)
# BROADCAST_IP - (Optional) Specific broadcast IP for this host
